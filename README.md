## Description
* Makes easier the manual labor of trees measuring:
   * input: full-height images of trees
   * helps calculating heights and widths of tree crowns relative to tree height
   * helps calculating intermediate tree trunk diameters relative to the tree's base diamater
   * output: measurements as numbers in the interface, or as a text file
* The application is portable and runs in a web-browser (implemented with JavaScript / P5.js)
* The application is authored by: Alexey Larionov:

## Installation:

> There might be my web-site running with this application, try:
> * [www.graphicsfore.pics](www.graphicsfore.pics)
> * [95.85.71.64](95.85.71.64)

### To run the application locally, Option 1:

1. first follow installation of p5.js
https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server

2. Download this repository source code, and configure the chosen server, so that it serves the repository root.

3. The application should be available. Try opening 
[http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html) in your browser

> NOTE: Though the port number may vary (5501). Clarify it with the specific chosen server.

### OPTION 2 (Windows)
You can try to launch [./libs/bin/RebexTinyWebServer.exe](./libs/bin/RebexTinyWebServer.exe) from this repository, it should automatically start a server. Open in browser: [http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html)

## Application usage

Please press button (Application Manual) in the menu window (on the right), to see the most relevant state of the instructions. Here's a shorter version:

### Key mapping
* Mouse wheel: zoom in/out
* Right mouse btn (press and hold): move the photo
* Left mouse btn (click): select a measurement:
	- (hold and move a measurement's endpoint): move the endpoint
  - (press and move a measurement line): move the whole line
* SHIFT (hold): the endpoints won't snap to parallel X/Y coordinates of other measurements 
* CTRL (hold): the lines will be hidden (should help to place the measurements more accurately)
* ESCAPE: duplicate the selected measurement
* DELETE: delete the selected measurement (can't delete the unit measurement, delete the group instead)
### Features
1. Press (Upload photo) button and select a file
2. The application menu has folders and sub-folders. Press a folder name to reveal its content (e.g. folder (Settings))
3. Folder (All measurements) is difided into groups of measurements. New groups can be created with a corresponding button. A unit measurement will be placed on the photo (its length will be considered 1.0, and all other measurements in the groups will compte their length relative to this unit)
4. Settings of a particular groups are located in the corresponding group folder. You can change: group color; group denotation (e.g. with group denotation 'a', all measurements in the group will be called by default 'a0', 'a1', etc.; absolute length of the unit (e.g. if a group measures relative to the tree height, and you know the tree height in meters, you can enter it here, and other measurements in the group will additionally have absolute lengths.
5. In the group folder, try using button (Add measurement).
6. Notice, that under this button, there are buttons corresponding to all the created measurements. Pressing those buttons, the measurement info will appear in the bottom section of the mnu with mark (üîç Selected measurement). In this section you can change sliders of coordinates (in case you can't do so on the photo), and you can give a special denotation for this particular measurement.
7. Create groups and measurements, place then with mouse on the photo (drag lines or endpoints, for convenience the latter will snap to parallel endpoints). The measurements of a single group are denoted with a single color, the unit measurement additionally has a circle in the line's center. Near the line there is denotation of the measurement and its relative (and/or absolute length in parentheses)
8. For convenience, use button (Load measurements preset), to quickly greate common groups (for measuing tree height, crown diameter, trunk diameter).
9. Additionally you can place a grid on the photo (look around in (Settings) folder).
10. Measurements can be saved in a file and loaded from a file (and displayed on the photo)
